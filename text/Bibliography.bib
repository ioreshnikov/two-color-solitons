abstract = {We consider the problem of the interaction of initially overlapping solitons with different frequencies in the frame of scalar as well as vector nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. By applying the inverse scattering transform technique, we find the amplitude and the velocity of the formed solitons as a function of the initial conditions. In particular, for the scalar case we calculate the threshold values of the frequency separation $\Omega$, when the solution transits from a two-soliton bound state to a one-soliton state ($\Omega$ $=$ $\Omega$1) and then back to a bound state ($\Omega$ $=$ $\Omega$2) and from a two-soliton bound state to a pair of escaping solitons ($\Omega$ $=$ $\Omega$3). If the initial frequency separation is less than the soliton spectral width, then perturbation theory may be applied. For other values of the frequency separation we calculate the soliton parameters numerically. We show that the bifurcation point at $\Omega$3 disappears if the amplitudes of the initial pulses are not equal. For the vector case we obtain similar results.},

These soliton states consist of a single circulating intracavity pulse with a modulated envelope that sits on a continuous wave background. Such temporal waveforms produce a frequency comb whose spectrum is spread over two widely-spaced spectral windows, each exhibiting a squared hyperbolic secant envelope, with the two windows phase-locked to each other via Cherenkov radiation. The first spectral window is centered near the 1550\&\#x00A0;nm pump, while the second spectral window is tailored based on straightforward geometric control, and can be centered as short as 750\&\#x00A0;nm and as long as 3000\&\#x00A0;nm. We numerically analyze the robustness of the design to parameter variation, and consider its implications to self-referencing and visible wavelength comb generation.}

abstract = {A novel adjustable adiabatic soliton compression scheme is presented, enabling a coherent pulse source with pedestal-free, few-cycle pulses in the infrared or midinfrared regime. This scheme relies on interaction of a dispersive wave and a soliton copropagating at nearly identical group velocities in a fiber with enhanced infrared transmission. The compression is achieved directly in one stage, without the necessity of an external compensation scheme. Numerical simulations are employed to demonstrate this scheme for silica and fluoride fibers, indicating ultimate limitations as well as the possibility of compression down to the single-cycle regime. Such output pulses appear to be ideally suited as seed sources for parametric amplification schemes in the midinfrared.}

The condition of the resonant scattering of dispersive waves on dark solitons is derived and compared against the results of the numerical simulations. It is shown that the interaction with intense dispersive waves affects the dynamics of the solitons by accelerating, decelerating, or destroying them. It is also demonstrated that two dark solitons can form a cavity for dispersive waves bouncing between the two dark solitons. The differences of the resonant scattering of the dispersive waves on dark and bright solitons are discussed. In particular, we demonstrate that two dark solitons and a dispersive wave bouncing in between them create a solitonic cavity with convex ``mirrors,'' unlike the concave ``mirror'' in the case of bright solitons.}

abstract = {We demonstrate that the optical event horizon can provide an effective technique to actively control the propagation properties of a dark soliton with another weak probe wave. Careful power adjustment of the probe wave enables the black soliton converted into a gray one with varying grayness through the nonlinear interaction, corresponding to a nearly adiabatic variation of the soliton\&\#x2019;s speed. The sign of the phase angle for the newly formed gray soliton at optical event horizon is significantly dependent on the frequency of the launched probe wave. Linear-stability analysis of dark solitons under the perturbation of a weak probe wave is performed to clarify the intrinsic mechanism of the nonlinear interaction. The probe wave manipulated collisional dynamics between both dark solitons are investigated as an analogue of the combined white-hole and black-hole horizons which provides some insights into exploring the transition between integrable and non-integrable systems.}

It is shown that for longer pulses the described effect persists also under the action of higher order perturbations such as Raman and self-steepening.},
