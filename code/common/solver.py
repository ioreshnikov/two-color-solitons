    Integrate a GNLSE using the integrating factor method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : array_like
        an array of time points where the integrated function should
        be evaluated
    x : array_like
        the coordinate grid
    u0 : array_like
        the initial condition at t[0]
    beta : callable with the signature of beta(f)
        the dispersive profile as a function of frequency
    nonlin : callable with the signature of nonlin(t, x, u)
        the nonlinear operator in the equation

    Returns
    -------
    (u, v) : a tuple of complex-valued matrices of shape len(t)Ã—len(x)
        output matrices of the integrated field in coordinate-domain
        and spectral-domain representations. Row number is position in
        the time array, column number is the position in coordinate/frequency
        array.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        when an integration step fails. Please examine the log for
