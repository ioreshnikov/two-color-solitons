    Integrate a GNLSE using the integrating factor method.

    This function integrates a generalized version of nonlinear Schrödinger
    equation

        ∂ₜ ũ = i β(k) ũ(t, k)
             + i γ(k) F{ N(t, x, u(t, x)) }
             + i F{ L(t, x, u(t, x)) },

    where ũ(t, k) is the spectrum of the unknown field, β(k) is a
    dispersive operator, and γ(k) is a gain coefficient. u(t, x) is the
    coordinate-domain representation of the same unknown field, and
    nonolinear operator N(t, x, u(t, x)) is defined in terms of that
    coordinate representation. L(t, x, u(t, x)) is an auxiliary linear
    operator that can be used to introduce an absorbing boundary layer.
    It does not have to have a physical meaning.

    The integration is performed using the integrating factor method as
    described by J.M. Dudley & J.R. Taylor in Chapter 3 of Supercontinuum
    Generation in Optical Fibers, CUP 2010. Instead of integrating the
    original equation we resort to integrating a modified version

        ∂ₜ v = i γ(k) F{ N(t, x, u(t, x)) }
             + i F{ L(t, x, u(t, x)) },

    where v = v(t, k) is the modified spectrum that is defined as

        ũ(t, k) = exp(i β(k) t) v(t, k).

    The modifed equation is supposed to be non-stiff, which allows us to
    apply almost any third-party solver. We chose a scipy-provided wrapper
    of ZVODE solver from ODEPACK, which offers error control and an
    adaptive scheme for step-size selection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : array_like
        an array of time points where the integrated function should
        be evaluated
    x : array_like
        the coordinate grid
    u0 : array_like
        the initial condition at t[0]
    beta : callable with the signature of beta(k)
        the dispersive profile as a function of frequency
    gamma : callable with the signature of gamma(k)
        frequency-dependent gain part of the nonlinear operator
    nonlin : callable with the signature of nonlin(t, x, u)
        time-domain part of the nonlinear operator
    lin : callable with the signature of lin(t, x, u)
        time-domain linear operator
    dt : float, optional
        an optional internal time step used for integration
    gpc : callable with the signature of gcp(t, x, k, u, v)
        an optional callback executed after computing up to the next
        grid point
